Stuff to fix / improve
	- rotate image to capture in portrait not landscape
		- the preview is already rotated
	- set a dimension for the image being captured
	- in CameraStreamingActivity.prepareFOrStreaming, the socket creation needs to be doen in an AsynTask
		- see SocketFactory.getConnectedSocket
	- in CameraStreamingActivity.stopStreaming
		- close the Socket
		- close/destroy the ImageStreamer
	- review the impementation of start* and disconnect* methods in IOTAccessPointActivity
	
Base activity for the purpose of this Android Application
	- has a preview frame to render camera preview
	- at startup (onCreate or onResume) tries to connect to the Server
		- server connection details can be saved in a Preferences type data
		- or hardcoded :)
	- can also connect to Bluetooth at startup
	- stays connected to the server Socket for 1 minute, waiting for commands from server
		- if no commands are received in 1 minute, disconnnects from socket and waits for another 1 minute\
	- same connection times can apply to staying connected to Bluetooth
	- when a command is received
		- connect to Bluetooth if not already connected
		- start listening/waiting for other commands
		- start streaming images
			- this can happen imediatly or based ona specific command that means just that
